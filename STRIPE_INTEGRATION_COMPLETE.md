## Overview
Your ecommerce project has been successfully connected to Stripe with real test keys. The checkout process now works with actual Stripe payment processing.

## Configuration Applied

### Backend Configuration
- **File**: `Backend/core/settings.py`
- **Secret Key**: Configured via environment variable `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- **Publishable Key**: Configured via environment variable `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Frontend Configuration
- **File**: `Frontend/src/lib/stripe.ts`
- **Publishable Key**: Already configured with your key
- **File**: `Frontend/src/storefront/components/PaymentForm.tsx`
- **Publishable Key**: Already configured with your key

## Test Results

### ✅ Payment Intent Creation
```bash
Status: 201
Response: {"client_secret":"pi_3S9ntN1P7OUaUZWm0m1SQfTu_secret_ZmZHu1vXQbOQYvgVmB46NcmRu","payment_intent_id":"pi_3S9ntN1P7OUaUZWm0m1SQfTu"}
```

### ✅ Real Stripe Integration
- Payment intents are being created successfully
- Real Stripe payment intent IDs are generated
- No mock responses (fallback mode is disabled)

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd Backend
python manage.py runserver 8001

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Checkout Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Add items to your cart
3. Go to checkout (`http://localhost:5173/checkout`)
4. Fill out the form completely:
   - Shipping address
   - Select shipping option
   - Payment information
   - Accept privacy policy
5. Click "Place Order"

### 3. Use Test Cards
For testing, use these Stripe test card numbers:

| Card Type | Number | CVV | Expiry | Result |
|-----------|--------|-----|--------|--------|
| Visa | 4242424242424242 | Any 3 digits | Any future date | ✅ Success |
| Visa (Debit) | 4000056655665556 | Any 3 digits | Any future date | ✅ Success |
| Mastercard | 5555555555554444 | Any 3 digits | Any future date | ✅ Success |
| Declined | 4000000000000002 | Any 3 digits | Any future date | ❌ Declined |
| Insufficient Funds | 4000000000009995 | Any 3 digits | Any future date | ❌ Declined |

## What Happens Now

### Successful Payment Flow
1. ✅ Payment intent created in Stripe
2. ✅ Payment method created and attached
3. ✅ Payment confirmed with Stripe
4. ✅ Order created in your database
5. ✅ Cart cleared
6. ✅ Redirect to order confirmation page

### Error Handling
- Invalid card numbers show appropriate error messages
- Declined cards display decline reasons
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- All errors are logged for debugging

## Stripe Dashboard

You can monitor all payments in your Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)
2. You'll see all test payments created through your checkout
3. Payment methods are properly attached to customers
4. All payment intents show correct status

## Security Features

✅ **PCI Compliance**: Card numbers never touch your servers  
✅ **Secure Processing**: All card data handled by Stripe  
✅ **Test Mode**: Using test keys (safe for development)  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages without exposing sensitive data  

## Next Steps

### For Production
1. **Replace Test Keys**: Get live keys from Stripe Dashboard
2. **Update Environment**: Set production keys in environment variables
3. **Webhook Setup**: Configure webhooks for production
4. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled

### For Development
Your integration is ready to use! The checkout should now work perfectly with real Stripe processing.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for Stripe API errors
2. **Check Frontend Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Keys**: Ensure keys are correctly set in settings
4. **Test Cards**: Use only Stripe test cards for development
