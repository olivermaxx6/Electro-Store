# Payment Validation Issue - Complete Solution

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

Your Stripe dashboard was showing payments as "Incomplete" with the error "customer has not entered their payment method" because:

1. **Backend was creating payment intents correctly** ✅
2. **Frontend was not completing the payment flow** ❌
3. **Payment methods were not being created/attached** ❌
4. **Payments were not being confirmed** ❌

## 🔧 Root Cause

The issue was in `Frontend/src/storefront/pages/Checkout.tsx` line 358:

```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN - undefined variable
const { error: stripeError, paymentIntent: confirmedPaymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(client_secret, {
  payment_method: paymentMethod.id
});

// ✅ FIXED - use correct variable
const { error: stripeError, paymentIntent: confirmedPaymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(paymentIntentResult.client_secret, {
  payment_method: paymentMethod.id
});
```
