🔍 Current Situation:
   Your payment intents are created but not completed with cards
   This is why they show "Incomplete" in Stripe Dashboard

📊 Payment Intent States:
   requires_payment_method → "Incomplete" (what you see)
   requires_confirmation → "Incomplete" 
   succeeded → "Succeeded" (what you want)

🎯 What You Need to Do:
   1. Test the frontend payment form
   2. Complete payments with test cards
   3. Watch them change to "Succeeded"

🔧 Your System is Working:
   ✅ Payment intents created in GBP
   ✅ Database integration working
   ✅ Webhook processing ready
   ✅ Order tracking implemented

💡 The "Incomplete" status is normal until payments are completed!
